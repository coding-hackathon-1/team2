Hey guys, the following are my notes from the meetings during class time on July 9th 2019.


Problem:
NUGs are coming to SF and have no understanding of the Housing Market in SF, furthermore Hult is limiting their accommodations to 55 students, and the incoming class is around 100 students.

Solution:
Housing Information for NUGs
Main companies (e.g. Avalon, 
Scams
Look for roommates
focus on and around the campus location

Questionnaire:
•Budget? 
•Roommates? (ho many?)
•Distance from campus
•Required Amenities 
•Preferred Amenities
	
Questionnaire for roommates

An App or Blog that would provide NUGs & RUGs with various information about the current state of the Housing market in SF. Furthermore the app will have a questionnaire to gauge what the user is looking for in terms of Housing (question will be such as budget, distance form campus, amenities, amongst some others). Another feature on the app will be to bring together potential roommates in a social media type of environment (try to implement Tinder's style a little).
